# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-using-Python (Pandas)

I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed my project on analyzing the average duration of movies on Netflix using pandas! I started by organizing the available data into a Python dictionary, capturing the movie durations for the years 2011 to 2020. Using this dictionary, I created a pandas DataFrame, which allowed me to manipulate and analyze the data efficiently.

After loading the data into a DataFrame, I performed various calculations and visualizations to gain insights into the trend of movie durations over the years. It was fascinating to observe that the average duration has indeed been declining during this period. Starting from 103 minutes in 2011, the average duration gradually decreased to 90 minutes by 2020.

By leveraging the power of pandas, I was able to compute statistical measures, such as mean and standard deviation, to quantify the change in movie durations accurately. Additionally, I created informative visualizations, including line plots and bar graphs, to visually depict the decreasing trend. These visualizations not only helped me understand the data better but also made it easier to communicate my findings to others.

Working on this project allowed me to exercise my Python skills and explore the vast possibilities of data manipulation and analysis with pandas. I'm excited to continue honing my data science skills and apply them to more real-world projects in the future.
